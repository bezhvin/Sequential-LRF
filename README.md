# Sequential-LRF
Employing sequential Low Rank Factorization to DNNs

This project aims at compressing a DNN trained with [KALDI ASR-toolikt]( http://kaldi-asr.org/) using sequential low-rank-factorization with SVD.

# How to use?
The project is made so that the lease possible changes need to be made in the Kaldi set up:
